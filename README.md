# sparkar-scripting-reference

Edit: Spark AR Team already reacted on my move and prereleased autocomplete for code editors.
So I will possibly stop working on this here. In the meantime you can join the new unofficial forum
for Spark AR at forum.sparkar.wiki

Frustrated with the limited possibilities to access the scripting references for
Spark AR I decided to log all modules and prepare them in a more readable format.

This readme will be updated.
